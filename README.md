# Hi there 👋

💧 I'm a hydraulic engineer with over 9 years of experience in the design of river training works, irrigation and drainage systems, bank protection structures, and other water infrastructure projects.

📘 Currently, I'm a PhD student at UACEG and separately following the Python development path at SoftUni.  
My goal is to apply my newly acquired knowledge to real-world engineering challenges, blending hydraulics with modern technologies.
